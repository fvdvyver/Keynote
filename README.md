#Cochrane Presentation App
This is an iPad specific app which aims to be a more performant implementation of the Cochrane Keynote presentation.

It uses the [VIPER](http://mutualmobile.github.io/blog/2013/12/04/viper-introduction/) architecture to separate responsibility and promote [Clean Code](http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882).

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) is used for dependency management. There are some pods from Mushroom Cloud's private repos that are used. The pods are included in the source repo, so this should not be a problem, however, it will probably not be possible to update the pods without access to the private repo. Please contact [Rayman](mailto:ray@mushroomcloud.co.za) or [Marco](mailto:marco@mushroomcloud.co.za) if this becomes a problem.
